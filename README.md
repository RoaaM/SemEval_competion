Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS)
- "Sexism: any abuse or negative sentiment that is directed towards women based on their gender, or based on their gender combined with one or more other identity attributes (e.g. Black women, Muslim women, Trans women)."


The task contains three hierarchical subtasks:

- TASK A - Binary Sexism Detection: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to predict whether a post is sexist or not sexist.
- TASK B - Category of Sexism: For posts that are sexist, a four-class classification where systems have to predict one of four categories: (1) threats, (2)  derogation, (3) animosity, (4) prejudiced discussions. - 
- TASK C - Fine-grained Vector of Sexism: For posts that are sexist, an 11-class classification where systems have to predict one of 11 fine-grained vectors.
